# NYC Subway SVG Example

Note that this project is almost entirely work done on pre-existing work (art (see *NYC Subway Map*) and code (see *road-trip*)) with minor modifications to suit this project's needs.

I did this project purely as an exercise based on [Romain Guy's excellent path-tracing blog post and code](http://www.curious-creature.org/2013/12/21/android-recipe-4-path-tracing/).

 - SvgTraceView.java is a slight modification (including rename) of StateView.java from road-trip
